# Logistic-Regression
Problem solved on Logistic Regression using R and  Python 


Logistic regression modelling on medical records to identify patients with cardio disorders.

Project: Predict heart disease (AHD - Atherosclerotic Heart Disease) based on various parameters including clinical parameters and risk factors.

Key Findings: AHD is more for Male patients than Female patients and presence of AHD increases with levels of RestECG. Based on the p value less than 0.05, there were five variables appearing significant out of fifteen variables. Size of test data was 30%;  by using the logistic regression the area under curve for training data was ~90% and for testing data was ~84%.

Tools and Skills: Time Series Forecasting and R studio.
